The day before yesterday

On Monday, it was sultry and as usual, I got up early and washed, then went straight to the classroom. The day was full of classes, and I soon got tired and didn't know what I had learned.Finally, I got through the last lesson, passed the long road, turned several corners, and returned to my dormitory. Passing the canteen on the way, I hesitated a little and felt too tired to eat. Looking out of the window, I don't know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. When I came to college, I was full of expectations, but now I am decadent. Later, regret accompanied me to sleep together, can not think why, then do not want to.

###Yesterday

Spring in everyone's eyes is colorful. Spring in the eyes of birds is a blue sky; spring in the eyes of bees is a colorful flower; spring in the eyes of fish is a rippling stream; spring in the eyes of horses is a green grass bud; spring in my eyes is a kite flying in the sky.
Spring wind blows Buddha's face, which is also the best time to send kites into the air. Look at the square. Kites are waving in the spring wind. Kites come in all kinds of colors, red, green and colorful. Kite shapes are also varied. Some are butterflies, some are airplanes, some are animated characters, and some are cute robotic cats. Look at the highest flying kite, but it's a square kite. Looking at the lawn, there was a child running with a kite, but the swallow could not fly anyway, like a sick swallow. And the people who have just come to the lawn are busy preparing to fly their beloved kites. In a few moments, all kinds of kites are flying in the sky.
Spring is hopeful and the best season of the year. I hope kites can bring people's hopes to the sky and bring people good luck.

###Today

The past education and the past experience, bit by bit, leave traces on us, and become us now.
Everyone has a lot of psychological imprints. The injured learns to protect themselves, the misunderstood learns that silence is golden, the regretted learns to cherish the present, and the ups and downs learns to be optimistic and strong.
The earth will not stop turning and Mars will not suddenly explode. The sun still rises in the morning and the moon hangs high at night. All things in nature grow regularly, but human joys and sorrows are always different.
Recently used wallpaper, there is only one sentence on it: loneliness to the extreme is happiness.
Yesterday's cause, today's fruit. All these are my destiny.
